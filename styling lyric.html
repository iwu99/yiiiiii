We live on a mountain
Right               at the top</br>
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain</br>
[Every morning I walk towards the edge]</br>
And throw little things off</br>
Like [car-parts], [bottles] and [cutlery]</br>
Or whatever I find lying around</br>
It's become a habit</br>
A way to start the day</br>
I go through all this<br>
Before you wake up<br>
[So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you]<br>
I go through all this<br>
Before you wake up<br>
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you<br>
It's real early morning<br>
No-one is awake<br>
I'm back at my cliff<br>
Still throwing things off<br>
I listen to the sounds they make on their way down<br>
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash<br>
Imagine what my body would sound like<br>
Slamming against those rocks<br>
When it lands<br>
Will my eyes be closed or open?<br>
I go through all this<br>
Before you wake up<br>
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you<br>
I go through all this<br>
Before you wake up<br>
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you<br>
I go through all this<br>
Before you wake up<br>
<div class="safe">So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you<div>
